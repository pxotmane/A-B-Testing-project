# Analyze A/B Test Results

## Introduction
A/B testing is basically a way to compare two versions of something in order to determine the most efficient one. In this project, my goal is to apply the A/BTesting to help decision-makers decide between two choices of proposals or strategies. 
This test is often used in sales and marketing strategies within companies. But it can also be used in other industries where the discount is between two proposals. In our case, A/B testing consists of comparing two versions of a web page (old page and new page) in order to verify which one performs better and get more converting visit to action in web page. These variations, called A and B, are randomly presented to users. A part of them will then be directed to the first version while the other will be assigned to the second.
